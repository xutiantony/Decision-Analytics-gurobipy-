Let $(x_i, y_i)$, for $i=1, \\cdots n$ be the data points and $a$ and $a_0$ the coefficients of the regression line $\\hat{y}=ax+a_0$.

The two constraints will force z to be at least larger than or equal to the absolute value of 𝑦𝑖−(𝑎1𝑥1𝑖+𝑎2𝑥2𝑖+𝑎0), and since the minization problem will force z to be at least smaller or equal to the absolute value, z must eqaul to the absolute value of 𝑦𝑖−(𝑎1𝑥1𝑖+𝑎2𝑥2𝑖+𝑎0)."

    "\n",
    "In Problem 9.1 and 9.2 of Assignment 1, we studied situations in which BalancedMilk wanted to make sure that each demand market receives at least some percentage of its demand. These strategies can be categorized under the umbrella of **fairness**, because they are trying to make sure that no demand market is left behind. In this problem, we will study another aspect of fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The situation is similar to Problem 2 of Assignment 1: $S_8$ is shut down, there is no \"not delivering\" cost, and BalancedMilk is committed to distribute all the milk it receives from the seven suppliers. Its goal, however, is different this time. Instead of minimizing the total transportation cost, BalancedMilk wants to **minimize the max fairness gap**. Before defining the maximum fairness gap, we need to define two things:\n",
    "1. The \"Demand Fulfillment Rate\" (DFR) of a demand market: the total amount of milk delivered to a demand market divided by its demand. \n",
    "2. The \"Fairness Gap\" (FG) between two demand markets: the absolute value of the difference between their DSRs.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose in the optimal allocation, BalancedMilk delivers 50 tonnes of milk to demand market 2 ($D_2 = 100$) and 90 tonnes of milk to demand market 3 ($D_3 = 150$). Then:\n",
    "$$DFR_2 = \\frac{50}{100} = 0.5, \\quad DFR_3 = \\frac{90}{150} = 0.6, \\quad FG_{2,3} = |0.5 - 0.6| = 0.1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the **maximum fiarness gap** is the maximum of all fairness gaps between all pairs of demand markets. For example, suppose there are only three demand markets, A, B, and C, and $DFR_A = 0.5, DFR_B = 0.6, DFR_C = 0.7$. Then, the maximum fairness gap is $MFG = FG_{A,C} = |0.5 - 0.7| = 0.2$.\n",

The manager informs you that they predict with 50% $S_8$ will be shut down soon. They want to **minimize their expected total cost.** In the following question, there is a not-delivering cost of 70 dollars per tonne of milk for each demand market that is not fully satisfied.\n",

That is, if $S_1$ increases its supply from the current 110 tonnes to 120 tonnes, BalancedMilk has to pay $20 \\times 10 = 200$ dollars to $S_1$. However, there is a catch! Those suppliers, who have also sensed the danger of an outbreak, want BalancedMilk to make its decision about the additional demand **now, before it becomes clear if $S_8$ is shut down or not.** But the good thing is that regardless of the $S_8$'s status, they will deliver the additional supply to BalancedMilk.\n",
